list, stacks, queues = important data types 

stack = the call stack
  - every function called is put onto the stack


abstract data types (ADT) = set of objects together with a set of operations
  - to implement an ADT you use data structures


list: a sequence of zero or more elements of a specified type
  - n = the size of the list; 0 = empty list
  - label elements A(0), A(1), ..., A(N-1)
  - predecessor of A(0) and successor of A(N-1) are typically not defined
  - sometimes you see something like END(L) to represent an abstract succesor to A(N-1)

  - some typical operations:
    - insert = insert a new element
    - delete = remove an element
    - findKth = provide access to kth element in list
    - find = find element with specific value
    - next = move to the next element
    - previous = move to the previous element
    - printList = display all of the elements

  - array based lists
    - you need an array plus a cariable storing the current size of the list
    - when using object oriented programming (oop) the array and size would be in an object
