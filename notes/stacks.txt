RAM - random access memory, 3 sections
  - static memory = stores global variables, machine code, and static data members
  - call stack (the stack) = run-time stack, stack frames
  - heap = stores all dynamically allocated memory
    - malloc, new, talloc, free

- Registers, Cache, and Virtual Memory are other memory

- the stack = a stack of activation records
  - whenever a function is called:
    - arguments = copied to parameters
    - certain registers are backed up (program counter, registers containing pointers to activation records)
    - many compilers back up all registers to keep things simple
    - space is set aside for all local variables and temporary variable
